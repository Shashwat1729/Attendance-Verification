# Attendance Verification

This repository contains a Python-based application designed to implement the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme's attendance verification using image analysis. The system leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to identify the number of people in an image, specifically focusing on the quality of images typically obtained from MGNREGA work sites. This project aims to establish a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for image capturing and verification for the upcoming year's MGNREGA scheme.

## Features

- **People Counting with YOLO**: Utilizes the YOLO model to accurately count the number of individuals in an image.
- **Image Quality Optimization**: Designed to work with the varying quality of images obtained from MGNREGA work sites.
- **Standard Operating Procedure**: Establishes guidelines for capturing and verifying images for MGNREGA attendance.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling a large number of images and providing accurate counts efficiently.
